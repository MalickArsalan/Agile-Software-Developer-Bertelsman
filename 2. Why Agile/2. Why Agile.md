In an increasingly interconnected and competitive global marketplace, I am seeing Agile being leveraged by successful organizations across the globe to thrive in todayâ€™s digital age. Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value in a world where we are constantly being challenged with Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. Organizations that I have seen go through Agile transformation have benefited from the following:

### Faster time to market.
  
- An agile approach accelerates product development cycles.
- Agile teams are able to release products anywhere from 50-80% faster than teams that continue to use a more traditional approach to product development.

### Early Return on Investment (ROI)
  
Agile helps us accomplish two things:

- Help squeeze cash out of Work in Progress (WIP).
- Increase project and portfolio return.
  
  Squeeze Cash Out of WIP | Increase Returns
  ----------------------- | ----------------
  **_Invest cash flexibly as product evolves_:** In Agile, by not allocating funds up front and hampering organizational liquidity, cash is freed up to more flexibly invest as the product evolves based on market needs.| **_Fail fast/stop early_:** Agile allow aus to fail fast or even stop early
  **_Less work on non-value added features_:** Waste, commonly referred to as the Japanese term Muda in real-world, is reduced by trimming down on unproven assumptions and mitigating the chances when investing in no-value added features. That is, features that are of no value and are probably a waste of resources. | **_Move funds to higher value project_:** This allows executive to move funds around from one project to another at a portfolio level.
  **_Better Prioritization_:** This helps a product management team prioritize features more proactively and steer towards better decisions for products's success. | **_Better alignment with the market_:** Priorities are re-evaluated more frequently and proactively to maintain a close alignment to the pulse of the market.

### Feedback From Real Customers
  
  Early feedback loop from the customer or proxy who represents the customer is priceless. Frequent feedback from the business and end-users ensures:

- **Focuses the team on the intended goal:**  The Agile team is focused on the solutions and intended goals.
- **Ensure delivery of high-value features:**
- **Allows the team to accommodate change:** Feedback loops alow the team to accommodate change later in development process, particularly as newer refined requirements emerge.

Organizations that go through Agile transformation have also benefited from:

### Build the Right Products

Developing and delivering products which customers do not want and for which there may not be a market can be an expensive adventure. Agile works to efficiently develop products where the chances of it being valuable customers and end users is enhanced.

- **Connects product strategy to execution:** Agile advocates for ensuring that the product strategy and execution remain aligned.
- **Iterative approach allows for adjustment:** The heartbeat of Agile is the iterative approach which allows for adjustment to ensure value-driven items are delivered in short time frames.
- **Communication and Collaboration:** The proactive and transparent collaborative communication stands in Agile, allows for constructive and genuine user and market-driven insight to ensure the product is heading in the right direction.

### Early Risk Reduction

Agile helps manage risks more proactively.

- **Risks are managed proactively:** By evaluating project progress more frequently, we are able to meaningfully evaluate during each iteration. This helps the team measure delivered value, as well as showcase working product to obtain realistic feedback.
- **Risk reduction accomplished through iterative delivery:** Specifically, risk reduction is accomplished through iterative delivery as requirements are discovered, prioritized, and demoed to representatives from the business, commonly referred to as business proxies in Agile.
  Agile exposes and provides the opportunity to recognize and manage risk early. Risks are managed through cross-functional teams that respect and understand each other's skills sets, sustainable and predictable pace, continuous feedback, and technical excellence, that is built-in quality.
- **Transparency ensures risks are managed early:** This transparency ensures risks are managed early.

### Built-in Quality

- **Business benefits justify the investment in quality:** Building and delivering high-quality products requires a commitment, but the business benefits and value delivered justify this investment.
- **Elevated customer satisfaction:** The business benefits from elevated customer satisfaction, as well as better velocity, which is essentially a measure of how much valuable work was completed in an iteration. The business also benefits from a more predictable pace of the products incremental delivery.
- **Ability to innovate and scale confidently:** A more reliable solution environment enables an agile team to confidently innovate and scale. 

### Culture and morale

- **Open communication, collaboration and cohesiveness:** Agile emboldens the culture by encouraging open communication, collaboration and cohesiveness driven by a common business value-driven goal.
- **Productive sustainable pace:** By breaking down silos, Agile promotes a more adaptable work environment that boost morale, prevents burnout, and encourage a highly productive, sustainable pace.
